# DOMCheckpoint1
In this mini project, I used JavaScript for the functionality of the page.
I used JS DOM events to;
1. Adjust the quantity of each item through  “+” and “-” buttons.
2. Delete items from the cart
3. Like items through a clickable heart-shaped button that will change color accordingly
4. See the total price adjusted according to quantity and deletions.
I have 2 JS files for the HTML. In the first file, I used splice function for the delete button to remove the card body (index) totally from the list-product on each click.
I also used the ternary operator to render the color change in the like button
In the second JS file, I declared the delete fumction and set it to delete the quantity on each click.
I also used the forEach method to iterate through each card(index).
I also added a flip card and tyles iy with CSS. I look forward to styling the flip card with JS. That is my next project.
